# IoT Network Traffic Data Malware Detection
This project explores detecting malware in IoT devices through network traffic data using machine learning with the 
IoT-23 dataset. The following machine learning models are implemented:
- Naive Bayes
- Support Vector Machine
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Multi-Layer Perceptron
- Convolutional Neural Network

## Requirements
- Python 3.10 or higher
- Keras
- Keras-tuner
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Tensorflow

## Setup
1. Download the small version of the [IoT-23 dataset](https://www.stratosphereips.org/datasets-iot23) and extract tar file
2. Run `moveDataset.sh` from the project directory
    - The dataset has the files nested within directories. This script will move all the data files to the dataset
        directory of the project
    - This script takes in an argument of the full path where the IoT-23 dataset was extracted to. For example if the
   dataset was extracted to your downloads folder on Linux the command would be:
   `./moveDataset /home/${username}/Downloads`
    - An alternative to this step is to manually move each `conn.log.labeled` file from the IoT-23 dataset to the dataset
   folder of the project
3. Install project requirements with `pip -r requirements.txt`

## Configuring the Project
- The input parameters for the project are in main.py
  - Altering `n_rows` will change how many rows from each file of the dataset are extracted for training
  - `run_mode` can be set to `mode.SEARCH` to run the grid search for optimal parameters or `mode.TRAIN` to train the models
  - `models` can be changed to control which models to run
